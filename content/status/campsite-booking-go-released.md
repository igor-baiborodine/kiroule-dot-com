I'm happy to announce that my seven months of hard work re-implementing the Campsite Booking API (or
Campgrounds API, more recently) in Go have paid off. The `v1.1.4`, along with
its [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ibaiborodine/campsite-booking-go/tags), has been
released today.

For more details, please see
the [campsite-booking-go](https://github.com/igor-baiborodine/campsite-booking-go) GitHub
repository.
