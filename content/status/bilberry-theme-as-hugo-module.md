I'm happy to announce that the Bilberry theme can be used as a Hugo module as of version `3.8.0`.
The [Quick Start](https://github.com/Lednerb/bilberry-hugo-theme#quick-start) section of
the `README` has been updated accordingly. The Hugo module option is now recommended when pulling
theme files from GitHub's Bilberry Hugo repository. Another option for adding theme files
via `git clone`, `git submodule`, or `zip file` is also supported. The theme's
demo [website](https://lednerb.github.io/bilberry-hugo-theme/) is now built and deployed using the
Hugo module approach.

I also migrated my personal website [kiroule.com](https://kiroule.com/) to using the Bilberry theme
as a Hugo module. The Bilberry Sandbox website is built and deployed in both modes:
on [Netlify](https://www.bilberry-sandbox.kiroule.com/) via git submodule and
on [GitHub Pages](https://igor-baiborodine.github.io/bilberry-hugo-theme-sandbox/) via the Hugo
module.
