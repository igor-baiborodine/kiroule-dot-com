In November 2021, I became the official maintainer of the Bilberry Hugo theme, and this post is a quick overview of how
this Hugo theme has evolved in 2022.

Back then, in November 2021,
I [asked](https://github.com/Lednerb/bilberry-hugo-theme/discussions/293) [Sasha Brendel](https://github.com/Lednerb),
the theme owner, if there were any plans for a new release since the last version of the theme was published on October
6, 2020. To which he replied that he did not have enough time to maintain it at the proper level and offered to join the
project and become an official maintainer. I accepted his offer and already published
the [2.5.0](https://github.com/Lednerb/bilberry-hugo-theme/releases/tag/2.5.0) release on November 5.
