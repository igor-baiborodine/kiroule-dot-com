Another year passed, and I decided to return to this project again and implement a new batch of
improvements. So, continuing the
series ["Campsite Booking API (Java)"](/series/campsite-booking-api-java/) with this installment, I
detail changes to the project and its current state.

Before I started any development on this iteration, I came up with a list of changes, which I
formalized using
GitHub's [projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects)
feature. To do so, I created
the [Campsite Booking 2023](https://github.com/users/igor-baiborodine/projects/1/views/1) project
with all the items I wanted to implement. Creating such a project helped me illustrate the scope of
the new iteration, plan my work, and track progress. And now, let's give more details of the most
significant changes.
