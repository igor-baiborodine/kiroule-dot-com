Summary

<!--more-->

Intro


- Describe briefly how the Algolia search functionality was enabled and configured in Bilberry Sandbox.
- The data upload to Algolia index was not automated.
- Easy way: use the same approach as in kiroule.com, i.e., call the upload script during deployment in Netlify.
- Hard way: use GitHub Actions trigger to upload to Algolia index on every commit or push to the master branch. Mention using GitHub Actions in the past for my other projects.
- Describe implementation details of the workflow: refer the README for part to execute the script
- Configure GitHub Actions secret - describe
- Suggest using this action for other sites deployed to GitHub pages. Add a link to the deploy action.
