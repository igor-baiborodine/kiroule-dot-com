In the [previous post](https://www.kiroule.com/article/start-blogging-with-github-hugo-and-netlify/), I showed you how to create a Hugo-based website and deploy it on Netlify. It's time to make some improvements, namely, configure DNS records, set up a custom domain and enable HTTPS.

When you deploy for the first time on Netlify, a Netlify subdomain will be assigned to your site, for example, `awesome-mclean-11186c.netlify.app`. Then you can change the randomly generated part in the subdomain to the site name you want, like adjusting `awesome-mclean-11186c.netlify.app` to `kiroule.netlify.app`, and continue as is.  But it's evident that for your personal website, you should use a custom domain, which helps a lot in promoting yourself as a brand and improving credibility. Also, owning a domain comes with the option of having personalized email addresses, for instance, `igor@kiroule.com`, which I put on my About page.

As for HTTPS, even if it's your blog where you do not collect any sensitive information, having a secure connection gives the perception of you as a trusted source. Other than that, it also can slightly improve your Google search engine rankings. 

This tutorial has the following tasks to complete:

1. [Configure DNS Records](#configure-dns-records)
2. [Set up Custom Domain](#set-up-custom-domain)
3. [Enable HTTPS](#enable-https)
4. [Update Base URL](#update-base-url)

The only prerequisite here is that you take care to purchase a domain name in advance. There are a few domain registrars where you can buy it (e.g., [Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/), [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/) or [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)). As for Netlify, they also sell and register domain names:

### Configure DNS Records
DNS (Domain Name System) records are rules that define how domain name servers handle traffic to domains and subdomains. Updating DNS records is a necessary step, once you obtain your custom domain. In our case, this will allow you to connect the domain to Netlify hosting. Since I bought `kiroule.com` domain name from Namecheap, it's shown here how to do that in my Namecheap account, but the same configuration procedure can be done with most of the domain registrars.

After signing in to Namecheap, select `Domain List` from the left sidebar and click on the `Manage` button:

![Namecheap Domain List](/img/content/article/configure-custom-domain-and-https-in-netlify/namecheap-domain-list.png)

In the `Details` view, choose the `Advanced DNS` tab:

In the `Host Records` section, add `A Record` and `ALIAS Record`entries.

`A Record` is an address record, which maps host names to their IPv4 addresses. To configure it, use the following settings:
```plaintext
Type: A Record
Host: @
Value: 104.198.14.52
TTL: 30 min
```
Here, the `104.198.14.52`  value is Netlify's load balancer IP address.

`ALIAS Record` is a virtual host record, which allows pointing one domain name to another one. To configure it, use the settings below:
```plaintext
Type: ALIAS Record
Host: www
Value: [name-of-your-site].netlify.app
TTL: 5 min
```

`TTL` (Time to live) is a propagation time, which defines how fast a DNS record update is pushed to DNS servers around the world.

### Set up Custom Domain

Sign in to Netlify and navigate to the site in question:

![Netlify Sites View](/img/content/article/configure-custom-domain-and-https-in-netlify/netlify-sites-view.png)

Select `Set up a custom domain` in the `Overview` tab:

![Netlify Site Getting Started](/img/content/article/configure-custom-domain-and-https-in-netlify/netlify-site-getting-started.png)

Enter your custom domain value and click on the `Verify` button:

![Netlify Site Settings Add Custom Domain](/img/content/article/configure-custom-domain-and-https-in-netlify/netlify-site-settings-add-custom-domain.png)

Then confirm that you own the domain name by clicking on the `Yes, add domain` button:

![Netlify Site Settings Add Custom Domain Owner Confirm](/img/content/article/configure-custom-domain-and-https-in-netlify/netlify-site-settings-add-custom-domain-owner-confirm.png)

To verify that the custom domain has been correctly configured, open the `Settings` tab and select the `Domain management` from the left sidebar. The `Custom domains` subsection should contain three domains: Netlify's default subdomain, your domain and your domain prefixed with `www.`.

### Enable HTTPS

Netlify hosting comes with free HTTPS for all sites, including the automatic creation and renewal of TLS-based certificates. These certificates are provided through [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), a nonprofit Certification Authority.

In the `Domain management`, scroll down to the `SSL/TLS certificate` subsection, then click on the `Verify DNS configuration` button:

![Netlify Site Settings Domain Management HTTPS](/img/content/article/configure-custom-domain-and-https-in-netlify/netlify-site-settings-domain-management-https.png)

Upon successful DNS verification, continue by clicking on the `Provision certificate` button:

![Netlify Site Settings Domain Management HTTPS Certificate](/img/content/article/configure-custom-domain-and-https-in-netlify/netlify-site-settings-domain-management-https-certificate.png)

Confirm once again the provisioning of Let's Encrypt certificate:

![Netlify Site Settings Domain Management HTTPS Certificate Confirm](/img/content/article/configure-custom-domain-and-https-in-netlify/netlify-site-settings-domain-management-https-certificate-confirm.png)

If the provisioning of the certificate were successful, the `SSL/TLS certificate` subsection would contain `Your site has HTTPS enabled` message as it's shown below:

![Netlify Site Settings Domain Management HTTPS Enabled](/img/content/article/configure-custom-domain-and-https-in-netlify/netlify-site-settings-domain-management-https-enabled.png)

### Update Base URL

Before testing the blog with new primary domains, it's necessary to update the `baseUrl` setting in your site's `config.toml` file accordingly. Otherwise, the website will not be correctly rendered.

```plaintext
baseURL = "https://www.kiroule.com/"
```

Commit and push the change to GitHub. This update should trigger a new build and deploy in Netlify. So go back to Netlify and verify in the site's `Overview` tab that the site was successfully published. 

![Netlify Site Deploy Change BaseURL](/img/content/article/configure-custom-domain-and-https-in-netlify/netlify-site-deploy-change-baseurl.png)

Now, it's time to test the new URL:

### Summary
In this article, I showed you how to enhance the newly created website. First, I demonstrated to you how to add new DNS records in a Namecheap account. Then you saw how to configure a custom domain and enable HTTPS in Netlify.  And the final step was updating the `config.toml` file to make sure that the blog is displayed without any issues.
