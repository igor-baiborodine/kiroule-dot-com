After publishing the article ["Configure Custom Domain and HTTPS on Netlify,"](/article/configure-custom-domain-and-https-in-netlify) one reader asked if the same instructions could be used to set up a custom subdomain. So in this post, I expand my answer and detail how to do this with external registrars.

<!--more-->

A subdomain or child domain is an extension of your primary domain name. 
Subdomains can be used not only to organize and navigate to different sections of a website but also to publish different websites. 
Since I own the `kiroule.com` domain, I could have published my blog under the `blog.kiroule.com` subdomain. Also, a subdomain can contain multiple levels, for instance, `info.blog.kiroule.com`.

You can create multiple subdomains in your main domain. 
The exact number of subdomains that can be configured should be checked with your domain registrar. 
For example, *Namecheap* allows you to use up to 150 subdomains per domain name.
