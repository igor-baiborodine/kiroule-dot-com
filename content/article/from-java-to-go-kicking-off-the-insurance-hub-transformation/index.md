### Raison d'Être or What's My Motivation

As a professional Java developer, I believe that real growth comes from stepping outside the
familiar. Learning another JVM-based language like Kotlin or Scala—even though they have their
strengths—doesn’t shift my mindset or challenge my habits the way picking up a language like Go
does. Go introduces me to entirely new programming paradigms and problem-solving approaches, thanks
to its minimalistic syntax, explicitness, and distinct concurrency model. Its straightforward
standard library and philosophy of “no hidden magic” push me to re-examine how I structure code and
systems. More importantly, Go is engineered for cloud-native development and microservices—domains
where modern software is heading—so adding it to my toolkit directly expands not just my technical
abilities but also my readiness for next-generation software challenges.

Making this leap is about more than simply adding a language to my resume. Immersing myself in Go
means grappling with new idioms, evolving my understanding of system design, and adapting to the
fast-paced, polyglot realities of today’s software teams. It positions me to contribute more
effectively in modern cloud environments and to approach both legacy migrations and greenfield
projects with renewed perspective and confidence. By embracing Go, I’m not just diversifying my
skill set—I’m deliberately preparing for where the industry is going, while also expanding the ways
I can create robust, scalable software solutions.

### Why Insurance Hub?

- Java project -> to Go, it's logical and simpler for me since I'm a Java developer
- Offer a candid description of how you selected this system—why not something simpler, or a
  greenfield project? (This helps frame the "real-world complexity" factor.)
- Highlight this as a "dual-learning project": growing Go skills *and* system
  architecture/modernization skills.
- Familiar business domain → lowers domain-knowledge risk.
- Technically challenging enough to stay interesting.
- Opportunity to cover much more than Go coding: migration of an existing system, system design,
  cloud deployment with k8s, CI/CD, testing strategies for replacement components etc.

### System Analysis Deep Dive

- Show a C4 simple architecture diagram or visual to engage readers.
- Instead of a dry summary, you could frame this as a **"Tale of Two Architectures."** Use your
  `system-overview-and-migration-analysis.md` to create a high-level comparison table or a "before
  and after" narrative.
  - **Before (Current State):** Java 14/Micronaut, mixed persistence (PostgreSQL, MongoDB), basic
    observability, non-cloud-native deployment.
  - **After (Target State):** Idiomatic Go, consolidated persistence (PostgreSQL with JSONB),
    gRPC-first communication, comprehensive observability on Kubernetes.
    This creates a clearer, more engaging picture for the reader.

### Migration Strategy Overview

- High-level phases (6-phase approach from your analysis) or use a simple phase table or timeline
  graphic to visualize the roadmap.
- Briefly introduce the “Strangler Fig” pattern and why phased, safe migration matters.

### Iterative Dev with GitHub Projects

- Include a screenshot (if possible) or a brief demo/description of how you set up your GitHub
  Project for solo work.

### How AI Tools Fit In

This is a very strong and unique point. Be sure to emphasize it. It will set my blog series apart
by integrating a highly relevant and modern topic into the development workflow. This is a great
way to attract a broader audience.

- AI as a learning accelerator
- Elaborate on JetBrains AI Pro, Junie coding agent, Perplexity—explain how they’ll speed up design,
  code reviews, and docs.
- Promise honest reporting on successes and failures with these tools.
