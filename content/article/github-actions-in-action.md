After trying to use GitHub Actions for the first time in my Campsite Booking API project, I migrated three more projects to GitHub Actions. In this article, I want to share my experience in automating software development workflows in GitHub repositories.

Back then, when GitHub couldn't offer full support for CI/CD pipelines, I opted to use the integration services provided by Travis CI and Circle CI. Therefore, it so happened that the CI workflows for the Vaadin Demo Bakery App and Vaadin Business App projects were implemented using Circle CI, and the CI/CD workflow of the Docker Liferay Portal CE project was implemented with Travis CI. After my first successful experience with GitHub Actions in the  [Campsite Booking API](https://github.com/igor-baiborodine/campsite-booking) repository, I decided to migrate the development workflows of my active projects to GitHub Actions.
