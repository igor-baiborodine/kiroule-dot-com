It's been 6 months since the inception of my website, [kiroule.com](https://kiroule.com), and it's time to take stock. On 29th April, I published my first article, ["Start Blogging With GitHub, Hugo, and Netlify."](/article/start-blogging-with-github-hugo-and-netlify/) Since then, I've published seven more articles while starting two series: ["Building Your Blog, the Geeky Way"](/series/building-your-blog-the-geeky-way/) and ["Hugo Theme Recipes."](/series/hugo-theme-recipes/)

Past month, I hit a new record for monthly users. As per Google Analytics, my website has had 414 users in October, totaling 1042 new users for the past 6 months.

Much to my surprise, the most popular article is ["Add Favicon to Hugo-Based Website."](/article/add-favicon-to-hugo-based-website/) At the moment of writing, Google Search ranks it **1st** out of 347,000 results when looking for content relevant to the `hugo` and `favicon` terms.

The 2nd and 3rd most popular articles are ["Configure Custom Domain and HTTPS on Netlify"](/article/configure-custom-domain-and-https-in-netlify/) and ["Manage Environment-Specific Settings for Hugo-Based Website,"](/article/manage-environment-specific-settings-for-hugo-based-website/) respectively.

But I'm not going to rest on my laurels - there is more new content to come! My editorial calendar for the near future includes articles on these topics:
- Content management using Netlify CMS
- Pinned posts in a Hugo Theme
- Video embeds in a Hugo Theme

Also, I'm planning to start a new series named "JAMstack Adventures." In this series, I will cover the following subject areas:
- Practical use of headless CMS, either Git-based or API-driven
- Deployment and hosting options for JAMstack applications
- Development of progressive web applications using Gatsby, Next.js, FaunaDB, GraphQL, serverless functions, etc.
