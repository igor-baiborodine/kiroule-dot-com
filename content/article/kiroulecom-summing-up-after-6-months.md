It's been 6 months since the inception of my website, [kiroule.com](https://kiroule.com), and it's time to take stock. On 29th April, I published my first article, ["Start Blogging With GitHub, Hugo, and Netlify."](/article/start-blogging-with-github-hugo-and-netlify/) Since then, I've published seven more articles while starting two series: ["Building Your Blog, the Geeky Way"](/series/building-your-blog-the-geeky-way/) and ["Hugo Theme Recipes."](/series/hugo-theme-recipes/)

Past month, I hit a new record for monthly users. As per Google Analytics, my website has had 414 users in October, totaling 1,042 new users for the past 6 months.

Much to my surprise, the most popular article is ["Add Favicon to Hugo-Based Website."](/article/add-favicon-to-hugo-based-website/) At the moment of writing, Google Search ranks it **1st** out of 347,000 results when looking for content relevant to the `hugo` and `favicon` terms.

The 2nd and 3rd most popular articles are ["Configure Custom Domain and HTTPS on Netlify"](/article/configure-custom-domain-and-https-in-netlify/) and ["Manage Environment-Specific Settings for Hugo-Based Website,"](/article/manage-environment-specific-settings-for-hugo-based-website/) respectively.

But I'm not going to rest on my laurels - there is more new content to come! My editorial calendar for the near future includes articles on these topics:
- Content management using Netlify CMS
- Pinned posts in a Hugo Theme
- Video embeds in a Hugo Theme

Also, I'm planning to start a new series named "JAMstack Adventures." In this series, I will cover the following subject areas:
- Practical use of headless CMS, either Git-based or API-driven
- Deployment and hosting options for JAMstack applications
- Development of progressive web applications using Gatsby, Next.js, FaunaDB, GraphQL, serverless functions, etc.

I concluded my first article, ["Start Blogging With GitHub, Hugo, and Netlify,"](/article/start-blogging-with-github-hugo-and-netlify/) with these words:
>I want to add that it is my second attempt to start blogging. My first try was in 2016, but it didn't go any further than creating an empty website. Back then, I used Jekyll and GitHub Pages to build and host the blog. I hope that my second attempt will be successful, and I will have enough time, focus, and energy to regularly publish new content.

And after 6 months, with eight published articles and 1,042 visitors, I can say that my second attempt was quite successful.

Stay tuned!
